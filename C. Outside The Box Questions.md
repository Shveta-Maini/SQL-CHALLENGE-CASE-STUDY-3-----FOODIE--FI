### SQL QUERY:

```sql
with monthly_revenue as
(
   select
        format(s.start_date, 'yyyy-MM') as month_year, 
        sum(p.price) as total_revenue
    from subscriptions s
    join plans p on s.plan_id = p.plan_id
    where s.plan_id != 0  
    and s.start_date between '2020-01-01' and '2021-04-30'
    group by format(s.start_date, 'yyyy-MM')
),
first_last_revenue as
(
    select 
        max(case when month_year = '2020-01' then total_revenue end) as first_month_revenue,
        max(case when month_year = '2021-04' then total_revenue end) as last_month_revenue
    from monthly_revenue
)
select 
    first_month_revenue,
    last_month_revenue,
    cast(round((last_month_revenue - first_month_revenue) * 100.0 / nullif(first_month_revenue, 0), 2) as decimal(10,2)) 
    as total_revenue_growth_percentage
from first_last_revenue;
